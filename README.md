<br />

Play the classic Minesweeper game on your server with this Discord bot! You can control the game
with turn-based commands just as the original, play in parallel with your friends and try to get
the biggest score. Featuring an 8Ã—8 procedurally generated board with 10 mines to discover and evade.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

**[To add this bot to your server, click this link]().**


> [!WARNING]
> **Currently, the bot isn't hosted, so it can't be used**. If you know how to setup a bot, feel free to use the source code to set the bot by yourself.

### How to play <a name="how to play"></a>

The provided instructions will teach you how to interact with this bot. If you don't know how to play vanilla
Minesweeper, I recommend [this article](https://minesweepergame.com/strategy/how-to-play-minesweeper.php).

* Start a new game with the `/start` command. The GUI is composed of the board, displayed with emojis,
the left tiles counter, the turn counter, and the name of the user.

* Reveal cells with `/r <row> <column>`. You'll need to provide the coordinates of your cell: they're
displayed in the border of the board, the rows being represented with letters and columns with numbers.
For example, `/r a 0` will reveal the cell in the top left side.

* Your first reveal will always be in an empty cell for safety.

* Same as `/r`, you can place flags with `/f <row> <column>`. Tip: if a number cell has as many flags around
its 8 touching cells as the number displays, you can *reveal the number cell* to automatically reveal the
remaining cells.

* The game advances one turn after each action. If you win or lose, a notification will display.

* You can always cancel your game with `/cancel`.

Use `/help` to view the instructions from the server.
